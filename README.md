# RSS - aggregator

[RSS](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) â€“ a specialised format designed to describe news feeds, article announcements and other content. This is the easiest way for websites (usually blogs) to allow users to subscribe for changes. Special services called RSS-aggregators are used for this purpose. These services know how to poll sites' RSS feeds for new posts and display them in a convenient way, marking what has been read and so on.
